                    <h2>What is this?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The goal with Moviz was to create a new, unique and explorative movie finding experience where the user get to interact with data and information in a new immersive way. We wanted to push the boundaries of what an information visualization can be and break out of the 2D world they are so often contained within.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project was not that much about creating the optimal movie-finding-service, instead we wanted to focus on something new, something creative. We wanted to create an experience for the user, with a purpose of exploration rather than an optimal way of finding movies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The end result is something that we really feel is something new and unique, it is a new take on the old used up treemap. You can explore the movie landscape in a new fashion by actually walking around in the 3D world where you are presented with a forest. Each tree in the forest is a movie and the shapes, colors and positions of the trees all depend on different data from that specific movie. This lets you explore not only specific movies, but cluster of movies from a specific time period, a specific genre or similar, in a new way.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Learning outcomes</h2>
                    <p>
                        What we have learned during this project is of course the tools we used to create this world, but also how to choose which data to display and how to display it. One of the major issues with the amount of data that is stored in the cloud is that no one really knows how to use it, and what to display. This was evident when creating a project like this, even the (relatively) small amount of data that exists about movies was difficult to process and later display.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We’ve also learned a lot about working together on a project with this many participants as this was something we haven’t done before. For a group of students who have basically never worked in projects with a group larger than 4. This was extremely useful, since in the “real world” - developer teams usually consist of 6 people plus a project manager, making this learning experience very beneficial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s quite hard to pinpoint precisely what a certain member of the team has done to the project, as we have worked very dynamically. We decided to go for an agile approach in regards to the workflow during the project. Our initial meeting consisted of trying to divide the project into different areas, which was not trivial considering we had not started coding yet nor had any idea of how big the project eventually could become. We ended up with three main areas in which we created smaller, more graspable tasks: frontend, backend and concept/idea. To help us during the project, we used the website Trello.com to organize the tasks and keep a structured overview of who was working on what at any point on the project. Furthermore, we all had a try in all the different areas in the project. For example, everyone was involved in the conceptual brainstorming and everyone has made efforts in the frontend programming of the application.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Technologies used</h2>
                    <p>
                        For the project, we used regular web technologies, such as HTML5 and CSS, but the main technology that has to be mentioned is JavaScript. Mainly, we used a JavaScript framework called Three.js. This allowed us to create the 3D-environment in which our visualization is shown. A database was created from movie data gotten from different API’s (OMDB and freebase) and PHP was used to get hold of that data. On the development-side of the application, we used a local Node.js server in combination with Gulp, BrowserSync and SCSS in order to work efficiently. For some unforeseen reasons, this development environment did not run smoothly for everyone in the beginning of the project which called for a bit of troubleshooting as we were running different operating systems with different versions of Node.js and PHP. These problems were later solved and we ended up with an efficient development environment that runs on every team member’s computer.

                        To keep track of our code structure, we used git. More specifically, we used a common git workflow where we create and work within so called ‘feature branches’ to minimize the risks of merge conflicts. Additionally, we tried to work with modularity in our code by creating several smaller scripts to split up the application’s functionality, making it easier to understand the architecture of the code. These modules are later compiled into one file using the JavaScript framework Gulp as we developed. Although, as everyone who has worked with git is aware of, you still run into merge conflicts sometimes no matter how careful you are!

                The size of the treecrown corresponds to it's IMDB-rating.
                <br /> The color of the crown represents the movie's feel, it's fetched from the movie's poster.
                <br /> The height and thickness of the stem shows the amount of votes.
                <br /> If there is a bird above the tree it means it has a song.
                <br /> And lastly, the position of the tree depends on it's release-year and it's main genre.
